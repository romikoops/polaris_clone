    <h3> Insurance</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Why is cargo insurance necessary?</b>
      <br />
      During transportation goods are exposed to the risk of damage or loss. Irrespective of whether
      transport is via ocean, road, rail or air, the carrier’s liability is always limited – usually
      per kilo. In case General Average (GA) is declared, the cargo insurance warrants to cover the
      cargos part of General Average salvage costs by issuing an average Bond. In case there is no
      cargo Insurance the Cargo owner has to provide a Bank Warrant / Payment Bond or other security
      accepted by the GA Adjuster that shows payment is secure.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Who needs Cargo insurance?</b>
      <br />
      There are terms of delivery in purchase agreements, such as FOB or CIF. The term of delivery
      determines whether it is the buyer or vendor who is at risk regarding damage to the goods and
      therefore may arrange for goods insurance. Therefore, we can offer a cargo insurance that
      covers the damage/loss of goods in the event of a claim on full terms ICC (A) clauses if
      integrated into the customer contract.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What does the insurance compensate?</b>
      <br />
      The goods insurance compensates the full value of the damage to the goods that can occur in
      transit. For example if the vessel is lost, a goods vehicle drives into a ditch, breakages and
      losses by theft in transit, transshipment storage as well as loading and discharging.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Doesn’t the carrier have any liability for claims and insurance cover?</b>
      <br />
      The carrier has insurance cover, but only for the liability stated by law and transport
      liability conventions and there are clear statutory rules governing the carrier’s liability
      for the damage to and loss of goods. It may often be limited or excluded so even if a carrier
      is liable for loss and/or damage caused to the goods during transport, such liability may be
      unsatisfactory for the customer. As a principal rule the goods owner should insure his goods
      and the carrier his liability.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Which insurance conditions are applied?</b>
      <br />
      Where import and export are concerned, the English ICC conditions (Institute Cargo Clauses) A,
      B or C are employed. Usually the A condition (All-risk).
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What affects insurance premiums?</b>
      <br />
      There are many factors that affect premiums, such as goods type, packaging, transport mode,
      destination etc. In general, however, one may say that the premium for packaged goods is of
      the order of magnitude 0.1-0.7 % of the stated insurance value.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Example of how an insurance premium could be calculated: </b>
      <br />
      Basis of premium calculation CIF + 10% X the actual premium rate (The actual premium rate
      applied on the total sum of cost of goods + freight + 10% margin).
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>How do I get it? </b>
      <br />
      It is simple, just tell your Greencarrier contact that you want to insure your goods and you
      will get a quotation. Basis of premium calculation CIF + 10% X the actual premium rate (The
      actual premium rate applied on the total sum of cost of goods + freight + 10% margin)
