      <br/>

      him affecting the carrying out of the order.
      These include
      <br />

      safety measures. If Dangerous Goods fall into
      scope of the law on the transport of dangerous
      goods (Gesetz über die Beförderung gefährlicher
      Güter [GGBefG]) or if other transported and stored
      goods fall into scope of other Dangerous Goods or

      required documentation.
      <br />
      3.3 In case of Valuable or Theft-Sensitive Goods,
      the Principal must inform the Freight Forwarder in
      text form regarding the type and value of the 
      goods and the current risks involved to enable the
      Freight Forwarder to assess the acceptance of the
      order or take appropriate measures for the safe
      and damagefree completion of said order. In case
      of acceptance of the order, the Freight Forwarder
      is obliged to undertake appropriate safety
      measures for protecting the goods.
      <br />
      3.4 The Principal is responsible for supplying the
      Freight Forwarder with all information, certificates
      and other documentation required, such as
      customs classification, for the correct processing of
      customs or other statutorily required handling of
      the goods, including, but not limited to, security
      checks for air freight shipments.
      <br />

      <b>4. Rights and duties of the Freight Forwarder</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      4.1 The Freight Forwarder shall act in the interest
      of the Principal, check the placed order for obvious
      faults and immediately inform the Principal, if
      required, about all dangers known by the Freight
      Forwarder for the fulfilment of the order. If
      required, the Freight Forwarder shall ask for
      instructions.
      <br/>
      4.2 The Freight Forwarder takes care that the
      Vehicles, loading safety means and, if their
      presentation is agreed, Loading Means are in a
      technically perfect condition, comply with
      statutory provisions and the requirements of the
      Freight Forwarding Contract. Vehicles and Loading
      Means shall be equipped with the typical
      appliances, equipment or methods for the
      protection of the goods, in particular loading safety
      means. Vehicles shall have low emissions and noise
      as well as low energy consumption.
      <br/>
      4.3 The Freight Forwarder shall deploy reliable,
      appropriate and, for the particular task in question,
      suitable and duly employed, qualified and trained
      drivers and, if required, with a driver certification.
      4.4 On foreign premises, the Freight Forwarder
      shall comply with the house rules, plant or
      construction site regulations in force, if they were
      announced to the Freight Forwarder. Section 419
      HGB remains unaffected.
      <br/>
      4.5 The Freight Forwarder is entitled to make
      customs clearance dependent on issuance of a
      written power of attorney that enables direct
      representation.
      <br/>
      4.6 If the Freight Forwarder is assigned with the
      cross-border transportation of the goods or the
      import or export customs clearance, the Freight
      Forwarder is, in case of doubt, also entitled to act
      in regards to the customs or other statutorily
      required handling of the goods, if the transport of
      the goods to the agreed destination would be
      impossible without such action. The Freight
      Forwarder is hereby entitled
      <br/>
      4.6.1 to open packaging whenever such action is
      necessary to comply with statutorily required
      controls (for example, Freight
      Forwarder as regulated agent), and, subsequently,
      to undertake all measures necessary to complete
      the order, such as repackaging the goods.
      <br/>
      4.6.2 to advance payments required by customs.
      <br/>
      4.7 In case of lost or damaged goods or for delay in
      delivery and upon request by the Principal or
      Consignee, the Freight Forwarder must procure
      immediately all required and known information
      for securing their compensation claims.
      <br/>
      4.8 In the absence of a separate agreement in the
      order supplied to the Freight Forwarder, the
      service does not include:
      <br/>
      4.8.1 the supply or replacement of pallets or other
      Loading Means,
      <br/>
      4.8.2 the loading and unloading of goods, unless
      otherwise indicated by circumstances or common
      practice.
      <br/>
      4.8.3 a transhipment ban (section 486 HGB does
      not apply),
      <br/>
      4.8.4 the allocation of a shipment tracking system,
      unless it is in line for this sector of industry,
      whereas clause 14 remains unaffected.
      <br/>
      4.8.5 returns, detours and hidden additional cargo.
      If in deviation to the actual order, one or more
      Packages are handed over and accepted for
      transportation by the Freight Forwarder, then the
      Freight Forwarder and the Principal conclude a
      new Freight Forwarding Contract on these goods.
      In case of returns or hidden additional cargo and in
      absence of a separate agreement, the terms and
      conditions of the original Freight Forwarding
      Contract will apply. Clause 5.2 remains unaffected.
      <br/>
      4.9 Further service and information obligations, for
      example
      quality management measures and their auditing,
      monitoring and evaluation systems as well as key
      performance indicators need to be expressly
      agreed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>5. Contact person, electronic communication and
      documents</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      5.1 Upon request of a contracting party, each side
      will nominate one or more contact persons to
      receive information, explanations and enquiries
      regarding the fulfilment of the contract and
      exchange names and addresses. This information
      needs to be updated in case of changes. If either
      contracting party fails to provide details for a
      contact person, then the relevant signatory to the
      contract shall be the designated contact person.
      Information obligations, which exceed the
      obligation in statutory provisions, for example
      measures of the Freight Forwarder in case of
      disruptions, in particular, an imminent delay during
      takeover or Delivery, obstacles to carriage and
      Delivery, damages to the goods or other
      disruptions (emergency concept) need to be
      agreed separately.
      <br/>
      5.2 In the absence of an expressly agreement,
      contractual statements by warehousing or
      transport personnel require approval from the
      respective party to be considered valid.
      <br/>
      5.3 The Principal takes care of the required
      declarations to be supplied by the Principal’s
      Shipper or Consignee during the fulfilment of the
      Freight Forwarding Contract at the Place of
      Loading and Place of Delivery, and of real actions,
      such as Delivery and receipt of the goods.
      <br/>
      5.4 If agreed between the Principal and the Freight
      Forwarder, the parties will transmit and receive
      the shipping details, including the creation of the
      invoice, by electronic means (electronic data
      interchange/remote transmission). The
      transmitting party carries the responsibility for the
      loss, completeness and validity of any sent data.
      <br/>
      5.5 In case of an agreement according to clause 5.4
      ADSp, the parties ensure that their IT system is
      ready for operation and that data can be processed
      appropriately, including the usual safety and
      control measures, to protect the electronic data
      exchange and prevent unauthorized access,
      modification, loss or destruction by third parties.
      All parties are obliged to give timely notification of
      any changes to their IT systems that could affect
      the electronic data interchange.
      <br/>
      5.6 Electronic or digital documents, in particular
      proof of deliveries, shall be considered equal to
      written documents. Furthermore, each party is
      entitled to archive written documentation in
      exclusively electronic or digital format and to
      eliminate originals, the latter always in
      consideration of the legal regulations regarding the
      same.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>6. Packaging and labelling duties of the Principal</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      6.1 The Principal shall pack the goods, and if
      required, clearly and permanently label all goods
      with their required identifications, such as
      addresses, marks, numbers and symbols relating to
      the handling and characteristics of the goods. Old
      identification marks must be removed or garbled.
      The same applies for Packages.
      <br/>
      6.2 Furthermore, the Principal is responsible for:
      <br/>
      6.2.1 identifying all Packages belonging to the
      same shipment, to ensure easy recognition,
      <br/>
      6.2.2 ensuring that Packages, if required, cannot be
      accessed without leaving external traces.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>7. Securing cargo and supervisory duties of the
      Freight Forwarder</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      7.1 In all cases where loading and discharge occurs
      at more than one location, the Freight Forwarder
      takes care for the security of cargo until the last
      Place of Discharge and at all times, but not before
      the completion of loading in a transport safety
      manner.
      <br/>
      7.2 The Freight Forwarder shall conduct controls at
      all Interfaces.
      <br/>
      The Freight Forwarder shall check completeness
      and identity of the goods, their apparent good
      order and condition as well as all seals, locks and
      record any irregularities.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>8. Receipt</b>
      <br/>
       <br/>
      8.1 The Freight Forwarder shall issue a certificate
      of receipt with reservations noted, if necessary.
      In case of doubt, the certificate of receipt issued by
      the Freight Forwarder only confirms the number
      and type of Packages, but not their content, value,
      weight or other measurements.
       <br/>
      8.2 Previously loaded or sealed loading units, such
      as containers or swap bodies and previously
      transmitted data, the accuracy of the certificate of
      receipt regarding quantity and type of loaded
      Packages is vitiated, if the Freight Forwarder
      notifies the Principal on differences (in quantity) or
      damages, immediately after unloading the loading
      unit.
       <br/>
      8.3 The Freight Forwarder must request proof of
      Delivery from the Consignee in form of a Delivery
      receipt listing all Packages as outlined in the order
      or other accompanying documentation. Should the
      Consignee refuse to issue a Delivery receipt, the
      Freight Forwarder must request instructions from
      the Principal. The Principal can demand the
      Delivery receipt for a period of one year after the
      goods have been delivered.
       <br/>
      8.4 As receipt for takeover or Delivery of the goods
      counts any signed document which gives evidence
      for fulfilment of the order, such as Delivery notes,
      forwarders certificate of receipt, consignment
      note, sea way bill, consignment bill or a bill of
      lading.
       <br/>
      8.5 The certificate of receipt and Delivery receipt
      can also be issued electronically or digitally, unless
      the Principal requests the issuing of a consignment
      note, sea way bill, consignment bill or bill of lading.
       <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>9. Instructions</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Upon conclusion of the contract, the Freight
      Forwarder must follow all instructions regarding
      the cargo, unless carrying out such instructions
      poses disadvantages to his business or damages to
      consignments of other Principals or Consignees.
      If the Freight Forwarder intends not to follow an
      instruction, then the Freight Forwarder shall
      inform the instructor immediately.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>10. Freight payment, cash on Delivery</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      10.1 Notifications by the Principal to the effect that
      the order should be executed freight collect or for
      the account of the Consignee or a third party, for
      example according to Incoterms,
      do not exempt the Principal from his obligation to
      pay the Freight Forwarder its remuneration and
      outlays, including freights, customs charges and
      other expenses. Freight collect instructions, for
      example according to section 422 HGB, Article 21
      CMR, remain unaffected.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>11. Default of loading and Delivery times,
      demurrage</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      11.1 In cases where the Principal must load or
      unload the Vehicle, the Principal has the obligation
      to do so within the agreed, otherwise within a
      reasonable loading and unloading time.
      <br/>
      11.2 If, in case of carriage of goods by road, the
      parties agree on a Time Frame or Point of Time or
      is such notified by the Freight Forwarder without
      objection by the Principal, Shipper or Consignee,
      the loading and unloading time – irrespective of
      the number of shipments per Place of Loading and
      Discharge – for full truck loads, but with the
      exception for bulk goods, for Vehicles with 40 tons
      maximum permissible weight shall be maximum 2
      hours per loading and per unloading in general.
      The times shall be reduced appropriately for
      Vehicles with a lower maximum permissible weight
      in the individual case.
      <br/>
      11.3 The loading or unloading time begins with the
      arrival of the road vehicle at the designated Place
      of Loading and Discharge (for example, by notifying
      the gate keeper), and ends when the Principal has
      completed all its duties. However, if a Time of
      Performance has been agreed for the arrival of
      road Vehicles at the Place of Loading and
      Discharge, the loading and unloading time does
      not begin before the agreed presentation time.
      <br/>
      11.4 In cases where the contractually agreed
      loading and unloading time are not maintained due
      to reasons beyond the Freight Forwarder’s scope
      of responsibility, the Principal must pay the Freight
      Forwarder the agreed, otherwise commonly
      accepted, demurrage fees.
      <br/>
      11.5 The aforementioned provisions apply
      accordingly, when the Freight Forwarder is obliged
      to load and unload the goods, and when the
      Principal is exclusively committed to prepare
      the goods for loading or to accept them after
      unloading.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>12. Performance hindrances and force majeure</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      12.1 If the Freight Forwarder is unable to take over
      the goods, or unable to take them over on time,
      the Freight Forwarder must immediately notify and
      seek instructions from the Principal. Section 419
      HGB applies accordingly. The Principal remains
      entitled to terminate the Freight Forwarding
      Contract, whereas the Freight Forwarder is not
      entitled to ask for compensation according to
      section 415 (2) HGB.
      <br/>
      12.2 Performance hindrances that do not fall
      within the scope of responsibility of either
      contracting party, free said parties of their
      performance duties for the duration of the
      hindrance and the extent of its impact. Such
      performance hindrances are defined as force
      majeure, civil unrest, war or acts of terrorism,
      strikes and lock-outs, transport route blockades,
      and any other unforeseeable, unavoidable and
      serious events. In case of a performance
      hindrance, the contracting parties are obliged to
      notify the other party immediately. Additionally,
      the Freight Forwarder is obliged to ask the
      Principal for instructions.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>13. Delivery</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      13.1 If, after arrival at the Place of Discharge, it
      becomes apparent that the unloading cannot take
      place within the time of unloading, the Freight
      Forwarder must immediately notify the Principal
      and request for relevant instructions. Section
      419 HGB applies accordingly.
      <br/>
      13.2 If the Freight Forwarder cannot adhere to the
      agreed Time of Performance or – in the absence of
      an agreement – to a reasonable time for Delivery,
      the Freight Forwarder shall request instructions
      from the Principal or the Consignee.
      <br/>
      13.3 Should the Consignee not be located at his
      residence, business premises, or in an institution in
      which he is a resident, the goods, always assuming
      there are no obvious doubts regarding the
      entitlement to receive the goods of the person
      in question, may be delivered to:
      <br/>
      13.3.1 at the residence: on an adult family
      member, a person employed by the family or an
      adult resident permanently sharing the
      accommodations,
      <br/>
      13.3.2 at business premises: on a person employed
      there,
      <br/>
      13.3.3 in institutions: on the head of the institution
      or a correspondingly authorised attorney-in-fact.
      <br/>
      13.4 In cases where the Freight Forwarder and
      Principal have agreed on Delivery without the
      presentation to an actual person (for example,
      night, garage or assembly line deliveries), Delivery
      is deemed to have taken place on the actual
      physical deposit of the goods at the agreed
      location.
      <br/>
      13.5 The Delivery can only take place under
      supervision of the Principal, Consignee or a third
      party authorised for reception. Clauses 13.3 and
      13.4 ADSp remain unaffected.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>14. Information and restitution duties of the
      Freight Forwarder</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      14.1 The Freight Forwarder is obliged to provide
      the Principal with the required reports and, on
      demand, to provide information on the status of
      the transaction and after carrying out the
      business to render account for it. However, the
      Freight Forwarder is only obliged to reveal costs, if
      the Freight Forwarder works on Principal’s
      account.
      <br/>
      14.2 The Freight Forwarder has the duty to give
      anything to the Principal what he has received by
      carrying out and managing the business.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>15. Warehousing</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      15.1 The Principal has the duty to pack and mark
      the goods, if required, and to make available all
      documents and information to the Freight
      Forwarder for an appropriate storage.
      <br/>
      15.2 The Freight Forwarder decides in its sole
      discretion if warehousing takes place in its own
      facilities or, if not otherwise agreed, those of third
      parties. Whenever warehousing takes place at
      third party warehouses, the Freight Forwarder
      must supply timely information regarding its name
      and location to the Principal or, whenever a
      warehouse warrant has been issued, to make a
      note of the information on the same.
      <br/>
      15.3 The Freight Forwarder takes care for the duly
      maintenance and care of the warehouse and
      storage space, the drives on the premises and for
      securing the goods, in particular theft protection.
      Additional security measures, for example
      measures exceeding the statutory fire protection
      laws, must be expressly agreed.
      15.4 Unless otherwise agreed:
      <br/>
      15.4.1 takeover of the goods for warehousing
      begins with the unloading of the goods from the
      Vehicle by the Freight Forwarder and the Delivery
      ends with the completion of the loading of the
      goods by the Freight Forwarder.
      <br/>
      15.4.2 inventory management is via the Freight
      Forwarder’s inventory accounting,
      <br/>
      15.4.3 there is one physical inventory inspection
      per year. On instruction of the Principal, the
      Freight Forwarder shall conduct further physical
      inventories against compensation.
      <br/>
      15.5 With taking over the goods and if appropriate
      examination means are available, the Freight
      Forwarder is obliged to conduct a receiving
      inspection on types, quantities, marks, numbering,
      quantities of Packages as well as outer visible
      damages according to section 438 HGB.
      <br/>
      15.6 The Freight Forwarder shall conduct regular
      inspections with appropriate personnel for
      securing the goods.
      <br/>
      15.7 In case of stock shortfall and imminent
      changes at the goods, the Freight Forwarder shall
      immediately inform the Principal and ask for
      instructions. Section 471 (2) HGB remains
      unaffected.
      <br/>
      15.8 Additional service and information obligations
      require an explicit agreement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>16. Remuneration</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      16.1 The services according to the Freight
      Forwarding Contract are compensated with the
      agreed remuneration, if this remuneration
      includes the costs for transportation and
      warehousing. Supplemental claims for costs
      occurred during regular transportation or
      warehousing and which were foreseeable at the
      time of the offer, cannot be claimed separately,
      unless otherwise agreed. Calculation errors are at
      the expense of the calculator. Sections 412, 418,
      419, 491, 492, 588 until 595 HGB and comparable
      provisions of international conventions remain
      unaffected.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>17. Compensation claims and right of recourse</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      17.1 The Freight Forwarder is, if not caused by his
      fault, entitled to ask for refund of expenses
      properly incurred, in particular those relating to
      average contributions, detention or demurrage
      charges, including additional packaging for
      protecting the goods.
      <br/>
      17.2 If the Principal instructs the Freight Forwarder
      to receive goods and if, on reception of the goods
      by the Freight Forwarder, freight, cash on delivery,
      customs duties, taxes, or other expenses and
      charges are demanded, the Freight Forwarder is
      entitled – but not obliged – to pay these costs
      according to the circumstances he has properly
      assessed, and to claim reimbursement from the
      Principal, unless otherwise agreed.
      <br/>
      17.3 On request, the Principal must immediately
      indemnify the Freight Forwarder for expenditures,
      such as freight, average contributions, customs
      duties, taxes and other fees demanded from the
      Freight Forwarder, in particular acting as a person
      authorised to dispose or as possessor of goods
      belonging to third parties, unless the Freight
      Forwarder is responsible for their accrual.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>18. Invoices, foreign currencies</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      18.1 Remuneration claims of the Freight Forwarder
      require the reception of an invoice or payment
      schedule in accordance to statutory requirements.
      If not otherwise agreed, the maturity is not
      dependent on presenting a delivery receipt in case
      of an uncontested Delivery.
      <br/>
      18.2 Regarding foreign Principals or Consignees,
      the Freight Forwarder is entitled to ask whether to
      receive payment in the relevant foreign currency
      or in Euro (EUR).
      <br/>
      18.3 If the Freight Forwarder owes foreign
      currency or has advanced foreign currency
      amounts, the Freight Forwarder is entitled to ask
      for payment in either the relevant foreign currency
      or in Euro (EUR). In case of Euro (EUR), currency
      conversion is made according to the official
      exchange rate on the day of payment, which shall
      be evidenced by the Freight Forwarder.
      <br/>
      18.4 Payment according to a credit memo
      procedure must be expressly agreed. In case of
      doubt, all credit memos are to be issued
      immediately, upon completion of services. Clause
      18.1 first sentence ADSp is not applicable for credit
      memo procedures.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>19. Set-off, Retention</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the face of claims arising from the Freight
      Forwarding Contract and associated non-
      contractual claims, set-off or retention is only
      permitted when the claim is due, uncontested,
      ready for decision or legally established.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>20. Lien and retention rights</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      20.1 The Freight Forwarder is entitled to secure its
      demands arising from freight forwarding services
      according to the legally permitted regulations
      regarding lien and retention rights.
      <br/>
      20.2 Lien rights can be exercised according to the
      legally established provisions, providing:
      <br/>
      20.2.1 the threat and the required notifications
      about the exercise of the legitimate lien and the
      sale of the pledged items by the carrier shall be
      forwarded to the Consignee,
      <br/>
      20.2.2 the time limit of one month as specified in
      section 1234 BGB is superseded by a time limit of
      one week.
      <br/>
      20.3 The Principal is entitled to prohibit the
      exercise of the lien by granting an equivalent
      security for its claims, such as a directly
      enforceable bank guarantee.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>21. Insurance of goods</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      21.1 The Freight Forwarder arranges the insurance
      of the goods (e.g. goods in transit or warehousing
      insurance) with an insurer of its choice, when the
      Principal assigns the Freight Forwarder to do so
      prior to handing over the goods.
      <br/>
      21.2 The Freight Forwarder shall arrange insurance
      for the goods, if this is in the interest of the
      Principal. The Freight Forwarder can assume that
      insurance is in the interest of the Principal, in
      particular when:
      <br/>
      21.2.1 the Freight Forwarder has arranged
      insurance for a previous Freight Forwarding
      Contract for the same Principal in the
      course of an ongoing business relationship,
      <br/>
      21.2.2 the Principal has declared a value of the
      goods for the purpose of insurance.
      <br/>
      21.3 The assumption that insurance is in the
      interest of the Principal according to clause 21.2
      ADSp is discounted, in particular
      when:
      <br/>
      21.3.1 the Principal has prohibited the purchase,
      <br/>
      21.3.2 the Principal is a Freight Forwarder, carrier
      or warehouse keeper.
      <br/>
      21.4 In case of purchasing insurance cover, the
      Freight Forwarder shall observe instructions of the
      Principal, in particular the amount insured and
      risks to be covered. In the absence of such an
      instruction, the Freight Forwarder must assess the
      type and scope of insurance in its sole discretion
      and purchase insurance cover at the usual market
      conditions.
      <br/>
      21.5 If, due to the nature of the goods to be
      insured, or for another reason, the Freight
      Forwarder is unable to purchase insurance cover,
      the Freight Forwarder will notify the Principal
      immediately.
      <br/>
      21.6 If the Freight Forwarder purchases an
      insurance after conclusion of the Freight
      Forwarding Contract and upon instruction
      of the Principal or recovers a claim or acts
      otherwise on behalf of the Principal regarding
      carrying out insurance claims or averages, the
      Freight Forwarder is entitled to a reasonable
      remuneration according to local standards,
      otherwise, an appropriate remuneration, in
      addition to the compensation of its expenses, even
      in the absence of a prior agreement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>22. Liability of the Freight Forwarder, Subrogation
      of claims of reimbursement</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      22.1 The Freight Forwarder is liable for damages
      according to the statutory provisions. However,
      the following provisions shall apply, in as much as
      they do not contradict mandatory regulations, in
      particular the law of pre-formulated terms and
      conditions.
      <br/>
      22.2 In all cases, where the Freight Forwarder is
      fault-based liable for losses or damages to the
      goods (“Güterschaden”) according
      to clause 23.3 and 24, the Freight Forwarder must
      only pay the value and reimburse the costs
      according to sections 429, 430, 432 HGB instead of
      damage compensation.
      <br/>
      22.3 In case of inventory divergences, the Freight
      Forwarder is entitled to balance the inventory with
      positive stock balance differences and stock
      shortfall of the same Principal for value
      evaluation in cases as set out in clause 24 ADSp.
      <br/>
      22.5 If the Freight Forwarder has claims, for which
      the Freight Forwarder is not liable for, against a
      third party in case of damages, or in cases when
      the Freight Forwarder has claims exceeding the
      sum for which the Freight Forwarder is liable,
      the Freight Forwarder must subrogate such claims
      to the Principal upon request, unless the Freight
      Forwarder has a separate agreement to pursue
      claims on behalf and at the expense of the
      Principal. Sections 437, 509 HGB remain
      unaffected.

      whenever the Principal has agreed to a Freight
      Forwarding Contract which is subject to a variety of
      transport means and includes carriage of goods by
      sea and an unknown damage place.
      In case of a known damage place, the liability
      according to section 452a HGB is subject to the
      liability exclusion and liability limitation of the

      <br/>
      23.1.3 Whenever Freight Forwarder’s liability
      according to clause 23.1.1 ADSp exceeds an
      amount of EUR 1.25 million per Damage Case, this
      liability is furthermore limited to EUR 1.25
      million per Damage Case, or to 2 SDR for every kg,
      whichever amount is higher.
      <br/>

      damages to the goods in its custody for Freight
      Forwarding Contracts which are subject to carriage
      of goods by sea and cross-border transportation is
      limited to the maximum statutory liability
      amount. Clause 25 ADSp remains unaffected.
      <br/>
      23.3 For all cases out of scope of clauses 23.1 and
      23.2, such as section 461 (2) HGB, 280 ff BGB, the

      goods is limited according to section 431 (1), (2)
      und (4) HGB to a maximum of:

      23.3.3 Furthermore, the Freight Forwarder’s
      liability is limited to the maximum amount of EUR
      1.25 million for each case of damage.
      <br/>
      23.4 The liability of the Freight Forwarder for all
      other damages than damages to the goods with
      the exception of damages during ordered

      Furthermore, the Freight Forwarder’s liability is
      limited for each case of damage to the maximum
      amount of EUR 125,000.

      (4), 523 HGB as well as any relevant mandatory
      liability provisions in international conventions
      shall remain unaffected.

      (CMNI), which extend Freight
      Forwarder’s liability or permit to extend.
      <br/>
      23.5 If Freight Forwarder’s liability according to
      Articles 23.1, 23.3 and 23.4 ADSp exceeds the
      amount of EUR 2.5 million per Damage Event, then
      Freight Forwarder’s liability is, irrespective of how

      24.1.3 EUR 70,000 per year, in cases where the
      damage claimed by the Principal bases, contrary to
      clause 24.1.2 ADSp, on a difference between
      calculated stock and actual stock of the inventory,
      irrespective of the amount and type of inventory
      taking and the amount of Damage Cases causing
      the difference in inventory.
      <br/>
      24.2 Upon payment of an agreed supplement and
      prior to warehousing of goods, the Principal can
      specify a value in text form for an increased liability
      that differs from the maximum amounts stipulated
      in clause 24.1. In this case, the specified value
      replaces the relevant maximum amount.
      <br/>
      24.3 In case of warehousing upon instruction, the
      Freight Forwarder’s liability for other damages,
      excluding damages to personal injury or goods of
      third parties, is limited to EUR 35,000 per case of
      damage.
      <br/>
      24.4 In case of warehousing upon instruction, but
      excluding personal injury or damages to goods of
      third parties, the Freight Forwarder’s liability is
      always limited to EUR 2.5 million per Damage
      Event, irrespective of how many claims arise from
      a single Damage Event. When there is more than
      one claimant, the Freight Forwarder’s liability shall
      be proportionate to individual claims. Clause 24.2
      ADSp remains unaffected.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>25. Exclusion of liability for carriage of goods by
      sea and inland waterway transportation</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      25.1 In accordance with section 512 (2) No. 1 HGB,
      it is agreed
      that:
      The Freight Forwarder in its position as carrier is
      not responsible for any fault or neglect on the part
      of its servants or of the ship’s company, insofar as
      the corresponding damage wascaused in the
      course of steering or otherwise operating the
      ship, or was caused by fire or explosion on board
      the ship and the measures taken were not
      predominantly for the benefit of the cargo.
       <br/>
      25.2 According to Article 25 (2) CMNI it is agreed
      that the Freight Forwarder in its position as carrier
      or actual carrier is not liable for damages and
      losses arising from:
       <br/>
      25.2.1 an act or omission by the master of the
      vessel, the pilot or any other person in the service
      of the vessel, pusher or tower during navigation or
      in the formation or dissolution of a pushed or
      towed convoy, provided that the Freight Forwarder
      complied with the obligations set out for the crew
      in Article 3 (3) CMNI, unless the act or omission
      results from an intention to cause damage or from
      reckless conduct with the knowledge that such
      damage would probably result,
       <br/>
      25.2.2 fire or an explosion on board the vessel,
      where it is not possible to prove that the fire or
      explosion resulted from a fault of the Freight
      Forwarder or the actual carrier or their servants or
      agents or a defect of the vessel,
       <br/>
      25.2.3 the defects existing prior to the voyage of
      his vessel or of a rented or chartered vessel if he
      can prove that such defects could not have been
      detected prior to the start of the voyage despite
      due diligence.
       <br/>
      25.3 Clause 22.4 ADSp remains unaffected.
       <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>26. Non-contractual liability</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In accordance with sections 434, 436 HGB, the
      above mentioned liability exclusions and
      limitations also apply to non-contractual claims.
      Clause 23.4.1 ADSp applies accordingly.
      <br/>
      <b>27. Qualified fault</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      27.1 Liability exclusions and limitations listed in
      clauses 22.2, 22.3, 23.3 and 23.4 in conjunction
      with 23.5, 24 as well as 26 ADSp do not apply when
      the damage has been caused by:
      <br/>
      27.1.1 intent or gross negligence of the Freight
      Forwarder or vicarious agents or
      <br/>
      27.1.2 infringement of Material Contractual
      Obligations, whereby such claims are limited to
      predictable and typical damages.
      <br/>
      27.2 Divergent from clause 27.1.2 ADSp, only the
      liability limitations of clause 24.1 and 24.2 ADSp do
      not apply in case of gross negligent or intentional
      infringements of Material Contractual Obligations
      only.
      <br/>
      27.3 Sections 435, 507 HGB remain applicable
      within their scope of application.
      <br/>
      27.3 Clause 27.1 ADSp is not applicable on
      statutory provisions, such as Article 25 MC, Article
      36 CIM or Article 20, 21 CMNI, which extend
      Freight Forwarder’s liability, allow extending or
      expanding the imputation of fault of servants or
      third parties.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>28. Liability insurance of the Freight Forwarder</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      28.1 The Freight Forwarder is obliged to purchase
      and maintain liability insurance at the usual market
      conditions with an insurer of his choice that, as a
      minimum, covers the ordinary liability amounts of
      its freight forwarding liability according to ADSp
      and statutory provisions. The agreement of
      maximum insurance amounts per Damage Case,
      Damage Event and year is permitted as well as the
      agreement of reasonable deductibles for the
      Freight Forwarder.
      <br/>
      28.2 Upon request, the Freight Forwarder is
      obliged to provide evidence of the liability
      insurance and its validity by presentation of an
      insurance confirmation within a reasonable
      Time Frame. In absence of such a presentation, the
      Principal is entitled to terminate the Freight
      Forwarding Contract extraordinarily.
      <br/>
      28.3 The Freight Forwarder is only entitled to rely
      on the liability limitations of the ADSp, when the
      Freight Forwarder provides an appropriate
      insurance cover at the time of order.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>29. Liability of the Principal</b>

      sections 414, 455, 468, and 488 HGB is limited to
      EUR 200,000 per Damage Event.
      <br/>
      29.2 The aforementioned liability limitation does
      not apply in case of personal injuries, such as injury
      of life, body and health, if the damage was caused
      by gross negligence or wilful intent of the Principal
      or its vicarious agents, or infringement of Material
      Contractual Obligations, whereas the latter is
      limited to predictable and typical damages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
