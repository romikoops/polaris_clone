In case the Customer does not receive the notice dispatched by the Company asking the Customer to take delivery of the goods, such shall not affect the Company’s aforesaid right to sell or dispose of the uncollected goods.

          any delay, goods shut out or off loaded, goods’ departure or arrival time; or
          any special, incidental, indirect, consequential or economic loss (including but not limited to loss of market, profit, tax, tax return, revenue, business or goodwill); or
          any loss, damage, expense or cost arising from fire, flood, storm, typhoon, explosion, port or airport congestion, deviation, strike, lock out, stoppage or restraint of labour

It is agreed that superficial rust, oxidation, discoloration, or any like condition due to moisture is not a condition of damage but is inherent to the nature of the goods, and acknowledgement of receipt of the goods by the Company in apparent good order and condition is not a representation that such conditions of rust, oxidation, discoloration, or the like did not exist on receipt.
      <br />
      <br />
        18.  If the Services are or are likely to be affected by any risk, delay, hindrance, difficulty or disadvantage of any kind whensoever and howsoever arising (including but not limited to port or airport congestion, strike, lock out, stoppage, restraint of labour, and/or the Customer’s failure to pay the Services charges that have been outstanding for 2 months or more), the Company may terminate and/or abandon the Services and place the goods at any place for the Customer to dispose of the goods, whereupon the Company’s liability and responsibility in respect of the goods shall cease.

If the Customer fails to deliver the aforesaid written claim notice to the Company and thereby prejudices the Company’s position in the claim, the Company shall in any event be discharged of all liability whatsoever and howsoever arising in respect of the claim.
      <br />
      <br />
        20.

      <br />
      <br />
        21.  The defences, exemptions and limitations of liability provided for in these Conditions shall apply in any action against the Company whether such action is founded in contract or in tort.
      <br />
      <br />
