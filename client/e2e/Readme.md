# End-to-end tests

## Known issues

`TypeError: Cannot read property 'bindings' of null`

It happens when `npm install` is used instead of `yarn install`

`
TypeError: Cannot read property 'catchError' of undefined

      31 |   } catch (e) {
      32 |     console.log(e)
    > 33 |     const { screen } = await puppeteer.catchError({})
`

Fixable with reinstalling with `yarn` command. If that doesn't help, try closing any opened `Chrome` browsers.

`

The only solution is to move the entire frontend application into itâ€™s own directory. We will do that as soon as we have somewhat stable test suite in the frontend.

## How to run e2e tests

1. `yarn install`

2. Set include `testRegex: '.spec.jsx$'` in `/client/jest.config.js`

3. Run `yarn test` for standard e2e test settings

4. Or run `yarn dev` for e2e test with additional delay

## Helpers

They are declared in `_modules/init.js` file.

### click(selector: string, index?: number): boolean

`
// Click first button
await click('button')

// Click fifth button
await click('button', 4)
`

### focus(selector: string): void

### exists(selector: string): boolean

It checks if DOM element, defined with `selector`, exist.

### count(selector: string): number

It counts how many DOM elements are matched with `selector`.

### fill(selector: string, text: string): void

Fill input form defined by `selector` with `text`.
Includes delay of 50 ms between each keypress

### waitFor(selector: string, count?: number = 1): boolean

It waits for 3 seconds for `selector` to return at least `count` number of DOM elements.

### waitForSelectors(selectors: string[]): boolean

It waits for 3 seconds for all `selectors` to return a DOM element.

### $(selector: string, fn: Function, args: string[]): any

Wrapper around `page.$eval`

### $$(selector: string, fn: Function, args: string[]): any

Wrapper around `page.$$eval`

### url(): string

It returns the current URL address.

### onError(): string

It returns information about the latest operation and the latest selector.

Useful to determine where exactly is the failing test assertion.
