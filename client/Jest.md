# Jest snapshot testing

Almost all of our components have snapshots and they can be quite useful for **React** developers.

1. Start `npm test:watch`
2. Make some changes to **React** component
3. **Jest** will notify you how your changes change the HTML output of the component.
4. Take a look at the snapshot changes and if this is the expected result, press `u` to update the snapshot.
