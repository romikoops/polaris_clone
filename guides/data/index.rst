Data Management
###############

One of most important tasks on ItsMyCargo Platform is data management. This
includes not only rates management but also client and companies management as
well user management etc.

Formats
=======

To upload any new data, usual and expected way is to prepare correct Microsoft
Excel sheet (`XLSX`) format, which contains necessary data in correct format.

Uploads
=======

To upload data, please visit Dipper as admin and navigate to relevant section
and upload through Data Manager.

All uploads are processed asynchronously, which means that data processing will
happen in the background. After processing is completed, you will receive an
email of the results. Usually this email should arrive within an hour, depending
on the sheet you have uploaded and how large sheet it was. Most uploads are
processed usually within minutes.
