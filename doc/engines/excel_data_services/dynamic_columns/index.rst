ExcelDataServices::V2::Files::Tables::DynamicColumns
====================================================

Sometimes the format of the sheet being uploaded has a free form element
to it. This class is designed to take any extra data (beyond what
already has defined columns in the DSL) found on the XLSX sheet and dump
the data into the data frame, essentially in the same format as found on
the raw XLSX.

It does this by ignoring the already defined columns and those defined
as excluded in the DSL and builds a Tables::Column object to pull the
data out of the sheet and into the regular Pipeline process

In order to bump up the functionality of this class we can allow for
these dynamic columns to have sanitizers and validators inferred from
the headers, as seen in the dynamic fee generation operation.

The headers of the columns generated by this class will be prepended with
`Dynamic:`
